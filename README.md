# IEEE754_32bitFP_sub_add_circuit_Proteus
We make an adder/subtractor for 32 bit floating point using Proteus.

## Tools
- Proteus


## Implementation Details

We make some modules like 8-bits and 24-bits adder and subtractor, 8-bit counter, 24-bit shifter, normalizer and some MUXs.

By connecting these modules as the way that add and sub operations done on 32bit floating points on paper, we make a 32-bit floating point add/sub calculator.

## How to Run

Just open the file in Proteus and run it.
